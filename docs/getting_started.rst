Getting Started
===============

The Zip-Tax.com_ sales tax API uses standard Representational State Transfer (REST_) principles for maximum flexibility with a wide range of program languages.

To get started, simply follow this documentation to build a reuqest using the Zip-Tax.com :doc:`api_request`, parse the :doc:`api_response` to validate the :doc:`api_response_codes`, and use the :doc:`api_results` in your code.

For questions or comments about this documentation, please contact us at support@zip-tax.com.
